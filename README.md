# Ramalama Local Querying with URL Indexing

This repository contains two scripts to help you add external URLs and index their content for local querying using Ramalama:

-   `rag_url_query.py`: This script is responsible for processing external URLs and integrating their content into the Ramalama indexing system.
-   `run-llama.sh`: This script likely orchestrates the local Ramalama environment, enabling you to query the indexed content.

Together, these scripts allow you to expand Ramalama's knowledge base with information from arbitrary URLs and query that information locally.
